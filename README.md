# Graphical models project:

In this project I studied an approach of two directed graphical models which are **Naïve Bayes Classifier (NB)** and **Tree Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN)**, study their points of similarity and difference, strengths, weaknesses and algorithmic complexity of each of them and at the end a numerical comparison in terms of predictive power of each model after applying them on the dataset.
